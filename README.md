# Affordable software for small development teams

The idea is to present opiniated list of  software that can be used by small development teams or individual developers because of their free or reasonable and affordable paid plans, or because they are open-source and can be self-hosted.

## Visit the generated website: [Software for small development teams](https://stribny.github.io/small-dev-teams-software/).

---

The list is stored in `data/data.csv` and the script generates screenshots and a simple one-page website that is published thanks to Github Pages.

The website can be regenerated with:
```
poetry shell && python main.py generate
```
